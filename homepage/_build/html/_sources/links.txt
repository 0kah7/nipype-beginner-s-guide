Links to Nipype, Programming and Neuroimaging
=============================================


Nipype
======

- `Nipype <http://nipy.org/nipype/>`_: The official homepage contains all about Nipype that you want to know.
- `Michael Waskom <https://github.com/mwaskom/nipype_concepts>`_ has written very nice introductions about `Workflows <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwaskom/nipype_concepts/blob/master/workflows.ipynb>`_, `Interfaces <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwaskom/nipype_concepts/blob/master/interfaces.ipynb>`_ and `Iteration <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwaskom/nipype_concepts/blob/master/iteration.ipynb>`_.
- A short and very nice introduction to Nipype, written by by Satra Ghosh, can be found `here <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nipy/nipype/blob/master/examples/nipype_tutorial.ipynb>`_.


Programming: Python, Git & more
===============================

I highly recommend to use `Sublime Text 3 <http://www.sublimetext.com/3>`_ to write and edit your scripts. It's a really good and cool looking text editor with many helpful plugins, like the `Anaconda Plugion <http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/>`_ for example.


Learn Python
------------

- `A Byte of Python <http://python.swaroopch.com/>`_: A very nice introduction to Python in general.
- `A Crash Course in Python for Scientists <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182>`_: a very good introduction to Python and scientific programming (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)
- `Codecademy - Python <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python>`_: An interactive online training and introduction to Python.
- `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html>`_: A very good step by step introduction to Python.
- `Python Scientific Lecture Notes <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>`_: A very good and more detailed introduction to Python and scientific programming.
- If you're looking for a Python based IDE like Eclipse or MATLAB, check out `Pycharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ or `Spyder <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/>`_.
- `Programming with Python <http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>`_: This short introduction by *software carpentry* teaches you the basics of scientific programming on very practical examples.


Learn Git
---------

- `Got 15 minutes and want to learn Git? <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>`_: Github's own git tutorial. It's fun and very short.
- `Git Real <http://gitreal.codeschool.com/>`_ on `Code School <https://www.codeschool.com/>`_: An interactive tutorial about GIT
- `Top 10 Git Tutorials for Beginners <http://sixrevisions.com/resources/git-tutorials-beginners/>`_


Learn Unix Shell
----------------

- `the Unix Shell <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_: If you're new to Linux, here's a quick starter guide by software carpentry that teaches you the basics.


Neuroimaging
============

- `Neurostars.org <https://neurostars.org/>`_: If you have any questions about Neuroinformatics, this is the place to go! 
- `Design efficiency in FMRI <http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DesignEfficiency>`_: A nice and detailed guide on how to design a good fMRI study.
