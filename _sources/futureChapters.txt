Ideas For Future Chapters
=========================

As Nipype itself, this user guide isn't finished yet and there's a lot more to come. So far my plans for topics for future chapters are the following:

* How to use **slicer** to create nice **functional pictures**
* How to **track a running workflow** with report
* How to use **nipype predefined workflows** like ``nipype.workflows.freesurfer.utils``

As I try to improve this user guide to make the learning curve for Nipype beginners as steep as possible, feedback, criticism, comments, ideas, recommendation etc. are highly appreciated: `mnotter@mit.edu <mnotter@mit.edu>`_
