Ideas For Future Chapters
=========================

As Nipype itself, this user guide isn't finished yet and there's a lot more to come. So far my plans for topics for future chapters are the following:

* How to extract anatomical and functional ROIs
* How to use slicer to create nice functional pictures
* How to use ANTS to normalize your subject specific data from subject space into a common template space
* How to use ANTS to create your own normbrain template
* How to trace a running workflow with report

As I try to improve this user guide to make the learning curve for Nipype beginners as steep as possible, feedback, criticism, comments, ideas, recommendation etc. are highly appreciated: `mnotter@mit.edu <mnotter@mit.edu>`_
